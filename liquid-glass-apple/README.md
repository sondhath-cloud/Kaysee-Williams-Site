Imagine tapping on a row of softly glowing app icons that appear to float on a thin sheet of glass hovering above your wallpaper. That’s Liquid Glass — Apple’s signature look in iOS 26 (and its sister operating systems) where every UI element becomes a translucent window into your background.

Under the hood, we wrap each icon in a .glass-container that applies a subtle blur and a gently rippling distortion filter, letting just enough of the wallpaper bleed through to hint at what lies beneath. A semi-opaque overlay tints the view, while bright inset highlights around the edges catch your eye and reinforce the sense of depth. When you hover over an icon, it pulses ever so slightly, like a droplet of liquid on a pane of glass.

This approach extends everywhere: notification banners, dialog boxes, even the lock screen and home screen. Every sheet, button, and window is crafted from this same liquid-glass material. The result is an interface that feels at once futuristic and tactile — as if you’re holding a perfectly transparent display, straight out of a sci-fi movie.
