## Database Field Reference

When reviewing feedback in phpMyAdmin, you'll see:

| Field | What It Means |
|-------|---------------|
| `layout_version` | Which layout option (1, 2, or 3) |
| `component_name` | Which section of the page |
| `feedback_type` | `like` or `suggest_changes` |
| `submitted_at` | When feedback was given |
| `additional_comments` | Theme preference details (for theme feedback) |

---

## Analyzing Feedback

### If Client Likes a Component:
1. Note the exact HTML structure
2. Note the CSS classes used
3. Keep the same layout pattern for final version
4. Don't make major changes to that component

### If Client Suggests Changes:
1. Follow up with client for specific details
2. Ask what they'd like to see different:
   - Color scheme?
   - Layout arrangement?
   - Font choices?
   - Spacing/sizing?
   - Content organization?
3. Create a revised version with changes
4. Present for another round of feedback

---

## Quick SQL to See All Feedback

```sql
SELECT 
    component_name,
    CASE 
        WHEN feedback_type = 'like' THEN 'üëç Likes it'
        WHEN feedback_type = 'suggest_changes' THEN 'üîÑ Wants changes'
    END as feedback,
    submitted_at
FROM client_feedback
WHERE layout_version = 'layout-option-2'
ORDER BY component_name, submitted_at DESC;
```

## Components WITHOUT Feedback Cards

These elements do NOT have feedback cards (as requested):

- **Theme Shuffle**: Moved to Theme Control Card instead
- **Cookie Consent**: Not a design component
- **High Contrast Toggle**: Accessibility feature, not design feedback
- **Mobile Hamburger Menu**: Part of mobile header (feedback covered by sidebar card)

---

## Next Steps After Receiving Feedback

1. **Count the Likes**:
   - Which components got the most "like" feedback?
   - These are your design winners to replicate

2. **Identify Change Requests**:
   - Which components got "suggest changes"?
   - Reach out for specific feedback on what to change

3. **Compare Across Layouts**:
   - If you send all three options, compare which components are popular across layouts
   - Mix and match: Use the hero from Layout 2, the footer from Layout 1, etc.

4. **Create Revision**:
   - Build a hybrid layout with all the "liked" components
   - Present for final approval

5. **Remove Feedback System**:
   - Once approved, delete all feedback cards
   - Launch the clean final version
